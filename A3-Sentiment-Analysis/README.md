This repository contains the W4 assigmnent for the course *Language Analytics*

# Sentiment Trends in the Headlines
It is difficult to draw any major conclusions or inferences, When eyeballing the plots displaying the rolling weekly and monthly averages in headline polarity scores. However, both plots display a slight dip in average scores during the first decaded which is subsequently followed up by a steady increase starting around 2010. It could be speculated that this rise may be a result of a surge in use of social media. The prevalence of these platforms may have pushed news media towards the use of more sensational headlines. Lastly, there seems to be a steep spike in average scores during 2020 which might be attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic.
